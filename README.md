This project involved building a structured dataset by scraping blog articles from corporate websites and engineering text-based KPIs to assess content performance. I developed and computed 15+ linguistic and sentiment variables, such as Fog Index, Subjectivity Score, Polarity Score, and Complex Word Count, to evaluate readability, tone, and complexity of marketing content.

These features were then used to create an interactive Power BI dashboard focused on SEO optimization and content strategy evaluation. The dashboard allows users to:

1. Identify articles with ideal sentiment and readability for search ranking

2. Detect blogs needing SEO revision based on tone, length, and complexity

3. Analyze content tone distribution (Positive, Negative, Neutral)

4. Assess subjectivity levels to balance objectivity with brand voice

The goal was to offer data-driven content insights that marketing teams or business analysts can use to refine communication strategies and improve organic performance.

The final output is a publicly usable XLSX dataset and an SEO-focused analytics dashboard, enabling future users to explore and extend the insights for content optimization, A/B testing, or marketing automation 
# Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze BlackCoffer blog articles by extracting and evaluating a range of linguistic and sentiment-based features. Using metrics such as word count, average words per sentence, average sentence length, percentage of complex words, and Fog Index, we assess the textual complexity and readability of each article. Additionally, sentiment indicators like positive and negative scores, polarity, and subjectivity scores help us understand the emotional tone of the content. Other features, including personal pronoun usage and average word length, offer deeper insights into the writing style and narrative voice. Together, these computed attributes provide a comprehensive, data-driven perspective on the language and sentiment patterns across the blogâ€™s articles
# Key Computed Variables
1. URL: The link to the original blog article used as the data source.

2. Cleaned_Article: The preprocessed version of the article text with noise (like HTML tags, punctuation, stopwords) removed.

3. Transformed_Text: The final form of the article text after tokenization, lemmatization, or other NLP transformations, ready for analysis.

4. Word_Count: The total number of words in the cleaned article, indicating article length.

5. Avg_Word_Per_Sentence: Average number of words used per sentence, useful for understanding sentence density.

6. Avg_Sentence_Length: The average number of characters or words per sentence, reflecting writing complexity.

7. Percentage_Complex_Words: Proportion of words in the article that are classified as complex (typically 3+ syllables).

8. Fog_Index: Provides an estimate of the readability of the content based on sentence and word complexity

9. Personal_Pronouns_Count: Number of personal pronouns (I, we, you, etc.) used, indicating subjectivity or personal tone.

10. Avg_Word_Length: The average number of characters per word, often correlating with vocabulary complexity.

11. Complex_Word_Count: Total number of complex words in the article, used in readability analysis.

12. Positive_Score: A measure of how many positively connotated words appear in the article.

13. Negative_Score: A measure of how many negatively connotated words appear in the article.

14. Polarity_Score: A normalized score reflecting the overall sentiment of the article (positive vs. negative).

15. Subjectivity_Score: A score representing how subjective (opinion-based) or objective (fact-based) the content is.

# Later Improvements
1. Use LLMs to finetune the cleaned Articles for News Summariser.

2. Deployment
